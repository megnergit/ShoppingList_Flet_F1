## Motivation

Commercial shopping lists are: 


- Their layouts are too loose. Generous spacing between the items.
  Huge waste of the realestate. I would like minimum waste and put
  maximum numbers of items on a limited space.

- They have a single long list. With time there will be a lot of duplications.

- I would like to have two lists:
  1. one for usual stuff that we buy every week.
  2. one for the stuff that we buy this week only.


  + The list i. can be recycled in the next wek.
  + The list ii. can be deleted in one go. We do not need to delete one item by one item. 
  

## How to run

To run the app on a desktop: 

```
flet run
```

In the directory that we have `main.py`.

To run the app on a iPhone:

```
flet run --ios
```

or 

```
flet run --ios --port 8011
```

'8011' can be any port number that you want to use.
